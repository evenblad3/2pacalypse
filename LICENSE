This the 2pac License, a regulation bout’ gettin’ paid when yer’ creative work's display'd. When yo’ work's used, it's yo’ time ta’ get yo’ props an’ get yo’ due.

Anybody can use yo’ stuff, no matta’ who. Ain't nothin’ they gotta’ do but credit yo’ name, tha's all.

You can make copies, share dem’ with yo’ homies, an’ even seel yo’ own version of it. Ain’ no stoppin’ yo’ hustle. Just gotta’ keep it real an’ spread tha' luv.

Yo’ can use this license fo’ whatever ya’ want--software, music, art, or even video games. It's yo’ creativity, an’ it's yo' call.

Bottom line, it's on yo’ head ta’ make sure tha’ folks get credited when they use yo’ stuff. Cause if they don't, they ain’t reppin’ yo’.

Peace.
